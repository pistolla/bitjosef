---
### Introduction ###
In nature marine animals and blind bats are known to use echolocation to navigate, find food or identify objects in their path. They generate their signal and listen to its reverberation on to different surfaces.

### What we want to do? ###
Our goal is to estimate distance between nearby device using high frequency audio sound that are inaudible to human ears.  

### What we need? ###
Android mobile phones with microphone.


### how we will do it? ###


Data collection?

preliminary testing?

conclusion?
